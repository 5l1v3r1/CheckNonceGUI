# CheckNonceGUI

GUI for my Checkm8 based APNonce Setter. This is a very simple swift app that will place your device into PWNDFU mode using ipwndfu/checkm8, let the user pick a valid previously saved SHSH file and grab the generator from it, place the device into PWNDREC mode and set the generator to that found in the SHSH file. This allows for downgrades/upgrades to unsiged iOS versions for compatible devices, limited to versions with a signed compatible SEP/Baseband for now. 

## Usage
Place the .app into "/Applications" and run it from there. 

## Building the project

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the xcode workspace (CheckNonceGUI.xcworkspace)
3. Add your Apple ID for signing
4. Run
5. Build and copy over the .app from wherever it is in "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData" to "/Applications"
6. Do whatever you want =)

## Running the app

1. Download latest release
2. Move the .app to "/Applications"
3. Run the app
